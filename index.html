<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a strategic and product-focused engineering leader with over a decade of experience in scaling engineering teams across various industries.
        My leadership has spanned high-growth companies, playing key roles in two IPOs and scaling the engineering team at AlphaSights from 30 to over 100 engineers across multiple geographies.
    </p>

    <p>
        At AlphaSights, I designed a transparent career progression framework that improved team retention, with 80% of new hires citing it as a key reason for joining.
        Additionally, I established an offshore engineering hub in Portugal, which accelerated hiring and reduced the time to market for new products.
    </p>

    <p>
        During my time at Trussle, I helped improve the companyâ€™s online conversion rate from 2% to 5% and increased website traffic by 30%.
        This was achieved through the strategic expansion of the engineering and data teams and by implementing CI/CD practices to improve delivery efficiency.
    </p>

    <p>
        At Funding Circle, I led the migration of a large-scale platform to a Kafka-based event-sourcing system.
        This upgrade enabled global scalability and significantly improved platform performance, reducing lead times for deploying new services.
    </p>

    <p>
        My expertise spans product development, team scaling, engineering process optimization, and cross-functional leadership.
        I am passionate about delivering measurable, high-impact results in fast-paced, innovative environments.
    </p>
