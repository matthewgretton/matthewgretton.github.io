        <h3>Building Development Processes to Optimise Product Experimentation</h3>
        <p>
            At <strong>AlphaSights</strong>, scaling product experimentation while maintaining focus on existing business lines was a challenge.
            A fixed-time, variable-scope development methodology was introduced to allow teams to experiment quickly while minimising risk.
            This led to increased experimentation and improved stakeholder engagement through a more transparent and predictable process.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scaled the process across teams in the UK, Portugal, US, and Brazil</li>
            <li>Increased product experimentation and stakeholder involvement</li>
            <li>Improved alignment between business goals and development efforts</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="career-progression" class="card">
        <h3>Designing Transparent Career Progression and Compensation Frameworks</h3>
        <p>
            At <strong>AlphaSights</strong>, challenges in team retention and hiring were largely due to unclear career progression paths and inconsistent compensation practices.
            A transparent career progression and compensation framework was created, providing clear documentation and expectations for promotions.
            This streamlined the promotion process, reduced management overhead, and increased employee satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>80% of new hires cited the framework as a key reason for joining</li>
            <li>Improved team retention and morale through clear promotion paths</li>
            <li>Reduced time spent on salary and promotion discussions</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="technology-standardisation" class="card">
        <h3>Standardising Technology for Scalable Growth</h3>
        <p>
            At <strong>AlphaSights</strong>, the diversity of the technology stack created onboarding challenges and inconsistencies across teams.
            To address this, the technology stack was standardised across the organisation, while allowing for innovation through a lightweight architecture review process.
            This ensured scalability, ease of maintenance, and consistency across geographies.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced onboarding time by unifying the technology stack</li>
            <li>Improved reuse of tools and documentation across teams</li>
            <li>Enabled innovation without sacrificing consistency</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="technical-competence" class="card">
        <h3>Building Technical Competence in Engineering Teams</h3>
        <p>
            At <strong>Funding Circle</strong>, the engineering team lacked the technical foundation needed to migrate to a Kafka-based event-sourcing platform, which was critical for scalability.
            To solve this, teams were restructured, and workshops and guilds focused on upskilling engineers were introduced. A core team built example services and documentation,
            guiding the broader team through the migration.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Successfully migrated to a scalable Kafka-based platform</li>
            <li>75% of the migration was completed during the tenure</li>
            <li>Improved technical competence across the engineering team</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="engineering-quality" class="card">
        <h3>Setting and Maintaining Standards for Engineering Quality</h3>
        <p>
            At <strong>Trussle</strong>, engineering bottlenecks and quality issues were slowing down product development and releases.
            Key engineering metrics, such as lead time and deployment frequency, were implemented to identify areas for improvement.
            Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) practices were introduced, increasing deployment speed and reducing downtime.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved website conversion rates from 2% to 5%</li>
            <li>Implemented CI/CD pipelines to speed up deployments</li>
            <li>Increased website traffic by 30%</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="stakeholder-engagement" class="card">
        <h3>Engaging Effectively with Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>
            At <strong>AlphaSights</strong>, internal teams struggled to prioritise complex business problems, such as fraud detection.
            Closer collaboration between engineering and compliance teams identified existing data that could be leveraged for fraud detection.
            A fraud detection tool was developed and deployed within a single six-week cycle, addressing key business concerns.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed and deployed a fraud detection tool in a six-week cycle</li>
            <li>Improved collaboration between engineering and compliance teams</li>
            <li>Addressed business-critical compliance concerns quickly</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="interview-processes" class="card">
        <h3>Creating Interview Processes for Scalable Hiring</h3>
        <p>
            At <strong>Funding Circle</strong> and <strong>AlphaSights</strong>, scaling the engineering teams required a more efficient hiring process.
            A streamlined two-stage interview process was developed, including a competency assessment followed by a collaborative workshop to assess cultural fit.
            This reduced time to hire while maintaining the quality of hires and improving the candidate experience.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced time to hire while maintaining quality</li>
            <li>Increased offer acceptance rates through a positive candidate experience</li>
            <li>100% of engineers cited the workshop as a key reason for joining</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="multinational-teams" class="card">
        <h3>Leading Multinational Engineering Teams</h3>
        <p>
            At <strong>AlphaSights</strong>, scaling engineering capacity was a challenge due to the competitive hiring environment in London.
            A new engineering hub was launched in Portugal, providing access to high-quality talent in a less saturated market.
            Standardised processes across locations ensured consistency and productivity, enabling scaling without compromising quality.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Established and scaled a new engineering hub in Portugal</li>
            <li>Standardised processes across multiple geographies</li>
            <li>Reduced time to market for new products through increased capacity</li>
